# MacUserGenerator
A utility that assists in automating the creation of macOS User Accounts.

MacUserGenerator (MUG) is written from the ground up, with ideas ***heavily*** inspired from [MagerValp's](https://github.com/MagerValp) [CreateUserPkg](https://github.com/MagerValp/CreateUserPkg).

## Features
*   [x] Export a user account as a **Shell script (sh)**.
*   [x] Export a user account as an **Installer Package (pkg)**.
*   [x] Ability to Open / Save the user account document / snapshot (MUGshot? ðŸ™ƒ).
*   [x] Nice to haves:
    *   User account can be hidden from the login window and the **Users and Groups** preference pane in **System Preferences.app**.
        *   User home folder can also be hidden.
    *   User can be set to login automatically.
    *   User can skip the Setup Assistant on first login.
        *   User can also skip iCloud setup.
        *   User can also skip Siri setup.
        *   User can also skip Touch ID setup.
        *   User can also skip Analytics setup.

## Under the hood (the nerdy stuff)
*   Export a user account as a **Shell script (sh):**
    *   Shell environment is bash: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
    *   The user account picture is embedded into the shell script (base64). No need for a separate image file!
    *   The user account password is hashed using [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) (your password does not appear in plain text anywhere).
*   Export a user account as an **Installer Package (pkg):**
    *   Package is payload free, it uses the script export mentioned above as a postinstall script within the package.
    *   Package will be signed with a [Developer ID Installer Certificate](https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/) (if selected) during export.
    *   Exports should work with targeted volumes (used in imaging workflows ie. [AutoDMG](https://github.com/MagerValp/AutoDMG)).

## Coming soon
*   [ ]   User account pictures are currently not being applied.
*   [ ]   Automatically enable Remote Login, Remote Management and no-password sudo

## Things I would love some help with
*   [ ]   A proper app icon. It's horrible.
*   [ ]   Maybe a better app name? **MacUserGenerator (MUG)** is a play on words on **CreateUserPkg (CUP)**. Open to alternatives ðŸ˜€.
*   [ ]   Ability for the user account to be allowed to unlock FileVault (FDE).

## Requirements
*   Written in Swift 4.0.
*   Built using Xcode 9.1.
*   Builds run on OS X El Capitan 10.11 or later.
*   Exports tested on macOS Sierra 10.12 and later.
